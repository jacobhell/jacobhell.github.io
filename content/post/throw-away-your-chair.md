I've been ground living for about two months now. By ground living I mean sitting on the ground instead of a chair.

At work I sit on the ground in a variety of positions:
1. Cross legged
2. Legs to one side
3. Knees bent
4. Squatting with back on couch/wall

I started doing this after reading Katy Bowman's book **Movement Matters**. Bowman argues that movement is **not** important for health, but necessary for health.

The more movement in your life the better. Bowman even suggests we open our car doors manually instead of wirelessly. And using loose leaf tea instead of bagged.

My back has certainly felt better. I also don't feel a need to stretch before or after a run.
