Today I discovered the IndieWeb. The IndieWeb is social media, a set of tools, and an ideology with a goal to break down the monoculture of the contemporary web.

Chris Aldrich, described the [problem](https://boffosocko.com/2017/07/28/an-introduction-to-the-indieweb/) of posting on social media today: 

> The seemingly difficult task these days is deciding where that should be. Thereâ€™s Twitter for sharing short updates and bookmarks to articles; Instagram, Snapchat, Flickr, and YouTube for photos and videos; Facebook for communicating with family and friends; LinkedIn for work and career related posts; Swarm for sharing your location; and literally thousands of others for nearly every micro-slice of content one could think of. 

He then gives a guiding principle for the IndieWeb:

> You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as http://www.example.com/ideas. These links are permanent and will always work.

The [wiki](https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started) page for IndieWeb is comprehensive and includes practical actions along with visions for the future.

I look forward to learn more about the IndieWeb. If I find my blog to be an [itch](https://indieweb.org/itches) I will look into adding [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) to syndicate elsewhere.
