<a href=/tags/pihole>pihole</a><div><p>I just couldn&rsquo;t take answering surveys on my smart TV anymore.</p><h3 id=setting-up-my-pi-hole-a-short-story>Setting Up my Pi Hole, a Short Story</h3><p>On a weekend night, I often find myself diving through the depths of YouTube. Unfortunately, every 5 minutes, I get interrupted by an ad for something I don&rsquo;t want like makeup subscriptions (I long ago disabled personalized tracking).</p><p>One day, I was perfectly content learning about Kombucha making. All of the sudden, Google absolutely needed me to fill out a survey. I held back a scream of rage and filled out the survey. This surrender truly shook me to my core.</p><p>Later that night, unable to sleep, I realized what I had to do. &ldquo;I need to install Pi Hole!&rdquo; I yelled with new found confidence.</p><h2 id=the-installation>The Installation</h2><p>So setting up Pi Hole is supposed to be really easy. It&rsquo;s often one of the first projects people install on their pi. To install it you just run a single bash command:</p><p><code>curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash</code></p><p>Easy peasy I thought, I should back to Kombucha videos in no time.</p><h2 id=the-router-the-pace-5268ac>The Router, the Pace 5268AC</h2><p>&ldquo;Not so fast&rdquo;, my router/modem combo said. It continued: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t change DNS settings on me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Darn&rdquo; I replied. A smile lit suddenly across my face. &ldquo;Well, good thing I can use Pi Hole as a DHCP server too!&rdquo;</p><p>The router/modem combo let out a hearty chuckle. &ldquo;Not so fast, you can&rsquo;t change DHCP settings either!&rdquo;</p><p>The blood rushed to my face.</p><h2 id=the-new-router>The New Router</h2><p>I bought a new router. I plugged it into the uplink port on my old router/modem combo. I could change the DNS settings. Victory.</p><p>My Raspbian installation imploded, figuratively. It wouldn&rsquo;t connect to the router via ethernet or wireless. Victory had been lost. To add insult to injury, I did not own an SD card reader, so I could not re install Raspbian.</p><p>Full of sorrow, I walked to Walmart and bought an SD card reader.</p><p>I reinstalled Raspbian. I reinstalled Pi Hole. It could connect to the router. I was blocking ads. My life became complete.</p><h2 id=lessons-learned>Lessons Learned</h2><ol><li>Make sure you can change DNS or DHCP settings on your router. If you can&rsquo;t, you need a different one. Or a different firmware like <a href=https://dd-wrt.com/>DD-WRT</a>.</li><li>Have an SD card reader when working with Raspberry Pis. You never know when you need to reinstall the OS.</li><li>Despite the challenges, a Pi Hole is fun and worthwhile.</li></ol></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/activities/gettingwatermelonatkroger20210527062148/>Getting watermelon at kroger 2021-05-27 06:21:48</a></li><li><a href=/activities/mediumlongrun20210526064137/>Medium Long Run 2021-05-26 06:41:37</a></li><li><a href=/activities/3miletempo20210525064458/>3 Mile Tempo 2021-05-25 06:44:58</a></li><li><a href=/activities/bikebackhome20210524070655/>Bike back home 2021-05-24 07:06:55</a></li><li><a href=/activities/29mintrailrun20210524062502/>29 min trail run 2021-05-24 06:25:02</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2021 <a href><b>Jacob Hell</b></a>.
