### The Importance of Privacy

As a techno-optimist, I believe that technology increases our freedom. One consequence of improved technology is loss of privacy. Our laws have not caught up to providing privacy as a [human right](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/01/data-privacy-or-data-protection-day-its-human-right-either-way).

Recently [in Japan](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/05/japans-rikunabi-scandal-shows-dangers-privacy-law-loopholes), a job recruiting web application sold algorithmically generated scores to Japanese companies, to determine if a candidate would decline an offer. Though Japan has a strong culture of data privacy, this scenario was legal.

Algorithms like this remove our humanity and transform our personalities to data. Though technology improves our lives, we must elevate our importance on privacy collectively.
