I&rsquo;m introverted and dislike interruptions. I&rsquo;m not good at small talk. I control the air conditioning. The reasons are endless.</p><p>Since the pandemic started, I&rsquo;ve been working from home. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the reasons I listed above. However, I didn&rsquo;t expect to be extremely productive.</p><p>I find myself most productive when in a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>state of flow</a>. In this state, I really only notice myself and the monitor. The keyboard is just an extension of myself. No bug deters me. Unfortunately, I only attain this state for around 30 minutes in the office. This is due to a combination of interruptions and not being in complete control my environment.</p><p>For example, I can wear whatever clothes I want. If my head or eyes hurt, I can just go lay in bed for 10 minutes. If the lights are too bright, I can dim them. I couldn&rsquo;t do that onsite.</p><p>Managing interruptions while working from home is easier. I only check my email 3 times per day at 8 am, 12 pm, and 4 pm. My phone number is available to members of my team, but I have the choice of answering calls. If called when I&rsquo;m in a state of deep flow, I can text back that I&rsquo;m not available. Then call when it works for me.</p><p>This might seem mean. But I&rsquo;ve found most urgent emails and calls are not urgent. This is what Cal Newport (one of my favorite authors) thinks about <a href=https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2008/02/15/fixed-schedule-productivity-how-i-accomplish-a-large-amount-of-work-in-a-small-number-of-work-hours/>keeping a fixed schedule</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>I’m not available.</strong> I often work in hidden nooks of the various libraries on campus. I check and respond to work e-mail only a few times a day. People have to wait for responses from me. It’s often hard to find me. Sometimes they get upset at first. But they don’t really need immediate access. And I will always respond within a reasonable timeframe and get them what they need. So they adjust. And I get things done.</p></blockquote><p>With complete control over my environment and no interruptions, I have averaged 4 hours of flow per day! It&rsquo;s probably the most productive I&rsquo;ve been in my life.</p><div class=blog-tags><a href=https://jacobhell.github.io//tags/productivity/>productivity</a>&nbsp;</div></article></div><footer><div class=container><p class="credits copyright"><a href=https://jacobhell.github.io/about>Jacob Hell</a>
