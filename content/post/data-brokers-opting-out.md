There's a lot of money being made from my data. Well not specifically my data, but our collective data. Just take a look at [Zuckerberg's](https://www.forbes.com/profile/mark-zuckerberg/?sh=1105174d3e06) net worth.

It's not just Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok that sell our data however. My personal data is bought and sold by dozens, or possibly hundreds of smaller companies. I wanted to know who these companies were, and stumbled on [this article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90310803/here-are-the-data-brokers-quietly-buying-and-selling-your-personal-information).

A [Vermont law](https://www.fastcompany.com/90302036/vermont-data-broker-law) requires data brokers to register with the state. There's a lot registered unfortunately.

### Opting Out

These companies are required to let you opt out of the collection and sale of your data. Here's a [convenient GitHub repo](https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md) with instruction stopping data collection from brokers.

The biggest caveat is that most of the opt-out actions require writing and sending emails or even physical letters. I hope to see this becoming all automated in the future.
