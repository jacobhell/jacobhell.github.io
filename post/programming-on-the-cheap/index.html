<a href=/tags/frugal>frugal</a><div><p>Like most people, I like to do things as cheaply as possible.</p><p>This thought extends to programming for me. Lucky for us who are software developers, a lot of the tools we get to use are free.</p><p>This includes programming languages with their compilers, IDEs and editors, and even operating systems. We can thank the pioneers of the
free software movement and GNU project for this.</p><div style=text-align:center><img src=../../535px-Heckert_GNU_white.svg.png alt="GNU logo" width=300 height=300></div><p>However, one thing we can&rsquo;t get for free is the computer that we write, compile, and run our programs on. Not only are computers not
free, they can be very expensive! In fact, on <a href=https://www.techradar.com/news/best-laptop-for-programming#8-asus-chromebook-flip>TechRadar</a>, the &ldquo;affordable&rdquo; option is the Asus Chromebook Flip. This machine retails for <strong>$579</strong>! If I was non developer looking to get into programming, I would be out almost <strong>$600</strong> before a single stroke of the keyboard.</p><p>Knowing this, I decided to pop into my local thrift store and see if there was a remedy for this insanity. That&rsquo;s when I found this beauty:</p><div style=text-align:center><img src=../../laptop1.jpg alt="Laptop found at thrift store" width=300 height=300></div><p>A gently used Dell Inspiron E1405 was in the technology section screaming my name. I looked at the price tag, only <strong>$20</strong>! What a steal! I quickly took out an Andrew Jackson and made off like a bandit.</p><p>I got home, turned it on, and realized it had Windows XP on it:</p><div style=text-align:center><img src=../../laptop2.jpg alt="Laptop with windows xp" width=300 height=300></div><p>I have no desire to program on a computer with an operating system that hasn&rsquo;t been updated in over a decade. That&rsquo;s where Linux comes in.</p><p>Now this was an old laptop, so I wanted to use a lightweight operating system on it. I ultimately chose Lubuntu, because it has LxQt, one of the lightest desktop graphical systems around. And I generally spend my time in the terminal emulator and vim, so I didnt&rsquo;t need too many out of the box features.</p><p>Lubuntu has a pretty straightforward <a href=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/InstallingLubuntu>installation process</a>. I had no problems going through the steps in the guide. I did mistakenly try using the 64 bit version instead of the 32 bit version, which is what the cpu required.</p><p>I could have avoided this though, if I looked it up beforehand: <a href=https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001121.htm>How to check</a></p><p>With the stress and anxiety of $600 laptops behind me, I was able to fire up my new to me Lubuntu powered laptop, and write this blog post with great amounts of joy and happiness.</p><div style=text-align:center><img src=../../hacking_on_lubuntu.png alt="Laptop using Lubuntu" width=600 height=450></div></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/post/5-16-21/>5-16-2021</a></li><li><a href=/post/java-16/>What's New in Java 16</a></li><li><a href=/post/gaming-pc-under-250/>How to Build a Gaming PC Under $250</a></li><li><a href=/post/reliability-scalability-maintainability/>What Are Reliability, Scalability, and Maintainability in Distributed Systems?</a></li><li><a href=/post/pipeline-nlp/>Implementing Pipeline from the SciKit Learn Module</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://jacobhell.github.io/><b>Jacob Hell's Blog</b></a>.
