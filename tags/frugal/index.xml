&lt;p>This computer is the defacto tower purchased by IT departments. Since there are so many, it is easy to get them used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tower is also designed to modular. The components are easy to replace, and you can easily fit a GPU into a PCIe port.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="where-to-find-one">Where to Find One&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I used &lt;a href="ebay.com">Ebay&lt;/a>. Here are the search parameters I recommend:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Search &amp;ldquo;Dell Optiplex Tower&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I recommend not getting a small or mini form factor case. It will be harder to find a GPU.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Apply only &amp;ldquo;Buy it Now&amp;rdquo; listings.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Sort by lowest price + shipping.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Check the boxes for 8GB and 16 GB RAM.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Check box for 3.00 - 3.49 GHz CPU speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I was able to buy a computer for $98 including tax and shipping using the above parameters. I did a search now and found a few options at $100.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total so far: &lt;strong>$100&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gpu">GPU&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to get a GPU right now. Ever since COVID-19 restrictions began demand has been very high. You can still find a good deal on Ebay though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some cards to look for that will fit the Optiplex:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>RX 560&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GTX 1050&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RX 570&lt;/li>
&lt;li>R9 280X&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Like I said, the prices are inflated a bit, but you should be able to snag one of these for $100. I was able to find an RX 560 for $106 with tax and shipping on Ebay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use a similar process to buying the Optiplex:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Type in the GPU model&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Apply &amp;ldquo;Buy it Now&amp;rdquo; listings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sort by lowest price + shipping.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Total so far: &lt;strong>$206&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="power-supply">Power Supply&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The final and cheapest part of the build. Don&amp;rsquo;t go used for this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use &lt;a href="pcpartpicker.com">PC Part Picker&lt;/a> to find a good deal on PSUs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On PC Part Picker:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Go to System Builder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select Power Supply.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Filter the Wattage to 500W max.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sort by lowest price.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I found &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARESGAME-Supply-Bronze-Certified-AGV500/dp/B08CXVKP3M/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=power+supply+500W&amp;amp;qid=1612702724&amp;amp;sr=8-3">this one&lt;/a> on sale for $43 with tax (had free shipping).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Total: &lt;strong>$249&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here are the benchmarks for my PC:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamebenchmark.com/">PC Game Benchmark&lt;/a> my build is at the 30th percentile of computer builds. So 70% of computers are more powerful than mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Howevever, you will be able to play ~30% of the top 1000 games played (including Fortnite, Valorant, GTA 5, and Rocket League) with recommended settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will also be able to play far more at minimum settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tldr">TL;DR&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Buy a used Optiplex on Ebay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buy a used GPU on Ebay&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Buy a PSU off Amazon.&lt;/li>

How to Program on a $20 Device.</title><link>https://jacobhell.github.io/post/programming-on-the-cheap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jacobhell.github.io/post/programming-on-the-cheap/</guid><description>&lt;p>Like most people, I like to do things as cheaply as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This thought extends to programming for me. Lucky for us who are software developers, a lot of the tools we get to use are free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This includes programming languages with their compilers, IDEs and editors, and even operating systems. We can thank the pioneers of the
free software movement and GNU project for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="text-align:center">&lt;img src="../../535px-Heckert_GNU_white.svg.png" alt="GNU logo" width="300" height="300">&lt;/div>
&lt;p>However, one thing we can&amp;rsquo;t get for free is the computer that we write, compile, and run our programs on. Not only are computers not
free, they can be very expensive! In fact, on &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-laptop-for-programming#8-asus-chromebook-flip">TechRadar&lt;/a>, the &amp;ldquo;affordable&amp;rdquo; option is the Asus Chromebook Flip. This machine retails for &lt;strong>$579&lt;/strong>! If I was non developer looking to get into programming, I would be out almost &lt;strong>$600&lt;/strong> before a single stroke of the keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing this, I decided to pop into my local thrift store and see if there was a remedy for this insanity. That&amp;rsquo;s when I found this beauty:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="text-align:center">&lt;img src="../../laptop1.jpg" alt="Laptop found at thrift store" width="300" height="300">&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A gently used Dell Inspiron E1405 was in the technology section screaming my name. I looked at the price tag, only &lt;strong>$20&lt;/strong>! What a steal! I quickly took out an Andrew Jackson and made off like a bandit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got home, turned it on, and realized it had Windows XP on it:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="text-align:center">&lt;img src="../../laptop2.jpg" alt="Laptop with windows xp" width="300" height="300">&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I have no desire to program on a computer with an operating system that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in over a decade. That&amp;rsquo;s where Linux comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now this was an old laptop, so I wanted to use a lightweight operating system on it. I ultimately chose Lubuntu, because it has LxQt, one of the lightest desktop graphical systems around. And I generally spend my time in the terminal emulator and vim, so I didnt&amp;rsquo;t need too many out of the box features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lubuntu has a pretty straightforward &lt;a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/InstallingLubuntu">installation process&lt;/a>. I had no problems going through the steps in the guide. I did mistakenly try using the 64 bit version instead of the 32 bit version, which is what the cpu required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could have avoided this though, if I looked it up beforehand: &lt;a href="https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001121.htm">How to check&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the stress and anxiety of $600 laptops behind me, I was able to fire up my new to me Lubuntu powered laptop, and write this blog post with great amounts of joy and happiness.&lt;/p>
