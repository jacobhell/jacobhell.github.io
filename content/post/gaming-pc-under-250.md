## The Dell Optiplex Series

This computer is the defacto tower purchased by IT departments. Since there are so many, it is easy to get them used.

The tower is also designed to modular. The components are easy to replace, and you can easily fit a GPU into a PCIe port.

### Where to Find One

I used [Ebay](ebay.com). Here are the search parameters I recommend:

1. Search "Dell Optiplex Tower"
    - I recommend not getting a small or mini form factor case. It will be harder to find a GPU.
    
2. Apply only "Buy it Now" listings.
3. Sort by lowest price + shipping.
4. Check the boxes for 8GB and 16 GB RAM.
5. Check box for 3.00 - 3.49 GHz CPU speed.

I was able to buy a computer for $98 including tax and shipping using the above parameters. I did a search now and found a few options at $100.

Total so far: **$100**

## GPU

It's hard to get a GPU right now. Ever since COVID-19 restrictions began demand has been very high. You can still find a good deal on Ebay though.

Here are some cards to look for that will fit the Optiplex:

* RX 560
* GTX 1050
* RX 570
* R9 280X

Like I said, the prices are inflated a bit, but you should be able to snag one of these for $100. I was able to find an RX 560 for $106 with tax and shipping on Ebay.

Use a similar process to buying the Optiplex:
1. Type in the GPU model
2. Apply "Buy it Now" listings.
3. Sort by lowest price + shipping.

Total so far: **$206**.

## Power Supply

The final and cheapest part of the build. Don't go used for this one.

You can use [PC Part Picker](pcpartpicker.com) to find a good deal on PSUs. 

On PC Part Picker:
1. Go to System Builder.
2. Select Power Supply.
3. Filter the Wattage to 500W max.
4. Sort by lowest price.

I found [this one](https://www.amazon.com/ARESGAME-Supply-Bronze-Certified-AGV500/dp/B08CXVKP3M/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=power+supply+500W&qid=1612702724&sr=8-3) on sale for $43 with tax (had free shipping).

Total: **$249**

## Benchmarks

Here are the benchmarks for my PC:

According [PC Game Benchmark](https://www.pcgamebenchmark.com/) my build is at the 30th percentile of computer builds. So 70% of computers are more powerful than mine.

Howevever, you will be able to play ~30% of the top 1000 games played (including Fortnite, Valorant, GTA 5, and Rocket League) with recommended settings.

You will also be able to play far more at minimum settings.

## TL;DR
1. Buy a used Optiplex on Ebay
2. Buy a used GPU on Ebay
3. Buy a PSU off Amazon.
