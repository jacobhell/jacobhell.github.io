So I failed my goal of writing everyday until the 16th. It sucks, but I'm passed it.

The pressure of writing interesting posts everday is uncomfortable. I enjoy writing, but not with pressure. Expectations and judgement cause my stress, and it makes writing hard.

I read [this post](https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more) and it spoke to me. I started this blog with a faint goal of "building a brand". The goal never materialized, but I liked writing. Joel, the author writes:

> Instead my approach now is to publish my thoughts more freely with less premeditation. Particularly in this space, which is mine, for me, by me.

> I don't lose the freedom to publish more polished work, it's just not my own personal expectation. 

He feels the pressure I do. Creativity isn't fun when you add expectations.
