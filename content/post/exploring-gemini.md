The dream of the 90s is alive in Gemini. Tired of the bloated, ad laden, javascript catastrophe that is the current web? Gemini is a return to simplicity. It is a protocol to distribute hyptertext documents. The [goals of Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.html):

> Gemini is intended to be simple, but not necessarily as simple as possible. Instead, the design strives to maximise its "power to weight ratio", while keeping its weight within acceptable limits. Gemini is also intended to be very privacy conscious, to be difficult to extend in the future (so that it will *stay* simple and privacy conscious), and to be compatible with a "do it yourself" computing ethos. For this last reason, Gemini is technically very familiar and conservative: it's a protocol in the traditional client-server request-response paradigm, and is built on mature, standardised technology like URIs, MIME media types, and TLS. 

## Getting on the Gemini Space

First, you need a client. Since web browsers support only http/https, a `gemini://` link won't work.

You can view the gemini space using an http proxy, like [this one](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/). Instead of using the proxy, you can download a [dedicated client](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/software/) for your machine.

## Discovering Content

I recommend using the [CAPCOM aggregator](https://portal.mozz.us/gemini/gemini.circumlunar.space/capcom/). This gathers unique posts from gemlogs (a blog in gemini). I have found quite a few interesting posts this way.

## Hosting Content

[Here's a list of software](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/software/) for running a Gemini server. I've not tried this yet.
