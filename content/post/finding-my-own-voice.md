In my post titled [5-16-21](../5-16-21), I disclosed my decision to write a post every day until 6-16-21. So far, I have averaged one post per day. I will admit, some of these posts have been written the day after the publish date.

I'm not even half way done, but I now feel self-assured with my writing ability. I don't require a strong dose of motivation to put pen to paper, or fingers to keys. The words are coming out easier and the sentences feel alike an extension of my mind.

Finding a unique and authoritative voice is my goal from this blog. Thought I can't quantitatively measure my progress, I can tell a difference.
