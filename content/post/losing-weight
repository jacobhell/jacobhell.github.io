### Two Ways I Have Actually Lost Weight

Trying to lose weight sucks. But I feel better when I am eating the correct amount of food. A hard balance I have is eating enough to not feel like crap, but not overeating to the point of feeling like crap.

Usually, I end up overeating. I'm not good at determining when I am actually full, and would rather feel stuffed than hungry. Plus, food is delicious.

To manage my weight, there are two strategies I use:

* Weighing myself every morning
* Writing down everything I eat

Make sure you weigh yourself at the same time on the same scale, to prevent variation. It doesn't matter how accurate your scale is, as long as it is the same one.

I don't recommend using MyFitnessPal or tracking all calories and nutrients. It's a lot of work, and I have never stuck with it. Just write down on Paper/App/Whatever everything you eat. I use TiddlyWiki, like I do for everything.
