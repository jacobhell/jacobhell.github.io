## Definition
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a modelling technique used for NLP.

I'm following along on this [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/spooky-nlp-and-topic-modelling-tutorial) to learn and explain these two techniques.

## Code
I have uploaded the jupyter file [here](https://github.com/jacobhell/learning-ml/blob/main/nlp-starter/main.ipynb).

And that's how you do it. I'm not entirely sure how it works yet either, but I am learning!
