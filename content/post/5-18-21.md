### Life Stacking and Life Ecology

We often consider our actions and interests in life to be separate pieces. I am a software developer, runner, and decent chef. You are a cartographer, scuba diver, and a master dominoes player.

The specialization of our roles would be unheard of in a hunter gatherer setting. You would just be considered a member of the tribe. You might be the best blackberry forager in your community, but that wouldn't be your identity.

In "Movement Matters", Bowman coins the term "Life Stacking". Life Stacking is defined as performing fewer tasks that meet multiple needs. So instead of being a software developer, runner, and decent chef, I could be a human who runs to the grocery store to pick up ingredients while selling mobile apps that help people LIfe Stack. I admit, I forced this example in here :).

A superior example is someone who wants to lose weight and save money. They could go on a budget, buy the healthier options at McDonald's, and drive to the gym daily. Or they could buy healthy ingredients from the supermarket while biking to word everyday.

It's an important exercise to look at our lives from the lense of an ecologist. How can we choose optimal tasks to increase our well being?
