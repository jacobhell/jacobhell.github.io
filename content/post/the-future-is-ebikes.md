Posting this a day late. I didn't have an opportunity to write a post yesterday.

Due to C02 emissions from automobiles, some people prefer to ride their bike. This is a simple transition, if all the places you need to travel to are nearby. And there are no hills on your routes.

Unfortunately, most of us in the United States aren't so lucky. It's not safe to ride on a [stroad](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/10/30/the-stroad) where cars will pass you going 50+ miles per hour. To get around stroads, there is usually a different path, though it may be a longer commute.

So we can wait for our local governments to make infrastructure pedestrian friendly, or we can make a personal decision to make riding a bike easier. 

If you haven't done so, take an e-bike out for a test ride. An e-bike provides all the environmental benefits of riding a bike, but you go faster with less effort. So if you need to take a longer commute to get around stroads and strip malls, an e-bike is a solution
