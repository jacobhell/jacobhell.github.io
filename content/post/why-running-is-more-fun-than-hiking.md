I run a lot. Most days actually, and I feel sluggish when I take a day off. Nature lovers enjoy slow leisurely walks on trails. These walks are often called "hikes".

A fast hike is called a "run". Not a jog. Never a jog. You also don't need to be on a trail to do a run.

I prefer going fast over going slow. Therefore I prefer running over hiking.

Here are some other reasons why running is better than hiking:

1. You get to places faster. Compare a 5 mile run-commute at 10 min/mile pace compared to a walk at 20 min/mile pace. 
2. You aren't encouraged to dump your whole paycheck on gear in running. To go out for a run you just need shoes and shorts. Hikers are told they need giant backpacks, trekking poles, water filtration, etc. from REI.
3. Hiking is something you think you need a trail for. You can run anywhere. You can run on trails too, this is call trail running.
4. You don't get dirty when you run. But you do get sweaty.
5. There's little variation in hiking. In a week of running you can do a long run, easy run, track workout, and threshold workout.
