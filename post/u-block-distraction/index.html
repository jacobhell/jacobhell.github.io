<a href=/tags/productivity>productivity</a><div><p>uBlock Origin is usually used to block unwanted ads. But it is also a powerful tool to increase productivity.</p><p>Like most people, I get distracted by shiny things easily. By &ldquo;Shiny Things&rdquo;, I mean interesting headlines, news articles, and videos.</p><p>I&rsquo;m different though, because I know that I need to block the shiny things before my feeble human brain can see them. Luckily, I know of just the tool to help me.</p><h3 id=ublock-origin>uBlock Origin</h3><p>The author and maintainer of uBlock Origin, Raymond Hill, is dedicated to privacy. Unlike other ad blocking services, uBlock specifically refuses donations and &ldquo;Approved Ads&rdquo;. So you have no reason to worry that things will get unblocked.</p><h3 id=the-problem-i-had>The Problem I Had</h3><p>So I have a website that I go on frequently. It is called <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/>StackOverflow</a>. It is a question and answer site for programming and computer problems. It is a part of a larger question and answer site called <a href=https://stackexchange.com/>StackExchange</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for those distracted by shiny things, StackOverflow has a &ldquo;Hot Network Questions&rdquo; section. This section has posts from other parts of StackExchange. The questions posted here are often very interesting, and they are difficult to resist clicking on.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p><p><figure><img src=../../network_posts.png alt="The bane of my existence"></figure></p><p>As far as I know, there is no way to hide this section. Even if you have a StackOverflow account.</p><h3 id=blocking-distracting-things>Blocking Distracting Things</h3><p>It&rsquo;s easy to block distracting things using uBlock Origin. Watch the gif below:</p><div style=text-align:center><img src=../../blocking_network_posts.gif alt="blocking network posts gif" width=800 height=600></div><p>I hope this helped on your quest to reduce distractions.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/post/java-16/>What's New in Java 16</a></li><li><a href=/post/gaming-pc-under-250/>How to Build a Gaming PC Under $250</a></li><li><a href=/post/reliability-scalability-maintainability/>What Are Reliability, Scalability, and Maintainability in Distributed Systems?</a></li><li><a href=/post/pipeline-nlp/>Implementing Pipeline from the SciKit Learn Module</a></li><li><a href=/post/setting-up-pihole/>Setting Up my PiHole, a Short Story</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://jacobhell.github.io/><b>Jacob Hell's Blog</b></a>.
