<a href=/tags/tech-criticism>tech criticism</a><div><p>This is a summary of the <a href=https://www.jasonfeifer.com/build-for-tomorrow/>Build for Tomorrow Podcast</a> episode titled: <a href=https://www.jasonfeifer.com/episode/you-are-not-addicted-to-technology/><strong>You Are Not &ldquo;Addicted&rdquo; to Technology</strong></a>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s vogue to assert that we are addicted to smartphones and social media. The evidence is clear. Kids use TikTok, Instagram, Fornite, and Minecraft, and mental illnesses increase. Except there&rsquo;s no correlation. Feifer provides the counterargument:</p><blockquote><p>In the spring of 2021 for example, the Oxford Internet Institute, which is a multidisciplinary research and teaching department at the University of Oxford, released a study of more than 430,000 children between the ages of 10 to 15, and found &ldquo;little association&rdquo; between technology use and mental health problems. So, if we are talking about identifying addictive disorders, a medical problem, as opposed to simply the pathologizing of a common behavior, then we need to know for real, where is the line between problem and not a problem.</p></blockquote><p>For gaming overuse, it&rsquo;s usually a coping dependency related to a different issue. Joel Billieux, an interviewee, tells us:</p><blockquote><p>For a lot of people, you can realize that the gaming is actually a coping that is displayed to face with social anxiety or trauma or depression.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In those cases, of course, you will not necessarily target gaming per se, you will target what caused depression. And then as a result, if you succeed, gaming will diminish.</p></blockquote><p>But why do we overuse these technologies? Nir Eyal, another interviewee, answers with the Self Determination Theory:</p><blockquote><p>There are two psychologists by the name of Deci, and Ryan, and they came up with the self-determination theory. Self-determination theory is the most widely accepted and study theory of human motivation, which says that all human beings for psychological well-being and flourishing, require three things.</p></blockquote><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory>Self-determination Theory</a>, also known as SDT, is a theory of human motivation and personality. It&rsquo;s mostly concerned with the motivation we have without external influences. According to SDT, we have common essential psychological needs. These needs are said to be the universal and innate need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.</p><p>Feifer offers his anecdote of overusing Twitter due to an SDT imbalance:</p><blockquote><p>Then I eventually left that job, and now I am very happy in my career. And I feel competent and autonomous and connected. And you know what? I don&rsquo;t look at Twitter much anymore. It is gone from a place I took refuge in to a thing that I look at briefly a few times a day just to see if anyone mentioned me. I wasn&rsquo;t addicted to Twitter, I was overusing Twitter. Twitter wasn&rsquo;t an addictive product, Twitter was exactly the same then as it is now. The problem was never Twitter, the problem was me.</p></blockquote><p>Throughout the podcast, Feifer repeatedly tells us to not discount legitimate mental health problems with technology. They very well could exist. But it&rsquo;s probably not an epidemic like many suggest.</p><p>I enjoyed the podcast, and recommend it.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/activities/3x1atthreshold6x30sechard1mineasy20210601064113/>3x1 at threshold. 6 x 30 sec hard 1 min easy 2021-06-01 06:41:13</a></li><li><a href=/activities/huntsvillerunning20210531081706/>Huntsville Running 2021-05-31 08:17:06</a></li><li><a href=/activities/huntsvillerunning20210529080053/>Huntsville Running 2021-05-29 08:00:53</a></li><li><a href=/activities/trailrun6x1minuphill20210528062758/>Trail Run. 6 x 1 min uphill 2021-05-28 06:27:58</a></li><li><a href=/activities/gettingwatermelonatkroger20210527062148/>Getting watermelon at kroger 2021-05-27 06:21:48</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2021 <a href><b>Jacob Hell</b></a>.
