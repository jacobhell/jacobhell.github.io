### Software is not a Panacea

Often, software is seen as a solution to the worlds problems. Supposedly, software will solve [Climate Change](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2021/01/04/how-artificial-intelligence-can-power-climate-change-strategy/), [car crashes](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-self-driving-cars/), and even [depression](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/top-iphone-android-apps).

Novel software is given significant praise for disruption, quirkiness, and ambition. This praise is inordinate. Software is well suited as a labor saving technology, but it's not going to fix anything that doesn't have a non software solution.

Sometimes, software can introduce problems. Young women are [harassed in dating apps](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/17/apps-tinder-dating-women) that were supposed to make romantic relationships easier. Bitcoin was supposed to take away power from corrupt financial institutions and governments, but [uses more power than some countries](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/27/bitcoin-mining-electricity-use-environmental-impact).

So let's make sure we understand the purpose of software. It is not a panacea, only a labor saving technology.
