I love to learn new things. An important component of happiness in aging is engaging your mind in new ideas. The new ideas can be music, art, athletics, literature, language, or really anything. There is no shortage of things to learn in this life.

As a software developer, I find enjoyment in creating and reading about new programming languages, frameworks, and other tools. 

When learning new things, a problem I have had is finding resources. Let's say I want to learn the [React framework](https://reactjs.org/). The [quickstart guide](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) looks like a good resource, but I prefer multiple sources. For any resource, there is always something missing that another resource covers.

So how do I find a secondary and tertiary resources? If I search "react tutorial" in my search engine, I'm bound to get tons of marketed, ad-based, and often not helpful links.

## GitHub Awesome Lists

The power of crowds delivers quality information, whether it's Wikipedia or other social media. To use the crowd sourced React resources, I just need to go to [this repository](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and ctrl-f for React. 

Doing so gives me [this list of resources](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react#readme). There is also this [search engine](https://app.polymersearch.com/discover/github-awesome), but I prefer the GitHub repo.
