### New Blog Theme

I use Hugo to generate my blog, and have changed themes. I now use the [smol](https://themes.gohugo.io/smol/) theme.

### Updating Blog Everyday

When updating this blog, I have waited for the inspiration to strike me. The goal of this blog is to improve my writing skill and bring my thoughts together in an organized way.

To increase the speed of increase of skill and thought cohesion, I am going to write every day for the next month, or 6/16/2021.

I was inspired by [this post](https://doctorow.medium.com/the-memex-method-238c71f2fb46) to do this. I'm not sure if I will ever write as much as the author, but I am interested in writing every day.
