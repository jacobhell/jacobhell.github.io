Today Google announced a new Operating System for it's Nest Hub called Fuchsia. I don't like the name. It is very hard to spell, in fact I had to triple check the name before I wrote this post.

Full disclosure: I don't write code for operating systems. I also don't know much about operating systems other than Apple, Windows, and Linux with it's various distros exist.

I enjoyed the comments on the [hacker news thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27280567).

[wolverine876](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wolverine876) makes the argument that we shouldn't be surprised with a new operating system. After all, Unix was developed 50 years ago and Linux was developed 30 years ago. At the time, the creators had no idea what the landscape of software technology would be.

Their full [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=27283089&goto=item%3Fid%3D27280567%2327283089):

> I'm suprised to find people surprised at the development of a new OS. Linux is around 30 years old; Unix and C are around 50 years old.

> Eventually the parameters of the world and of user needs shift far enough from the original design that it's less expensive to develop something new than to adapt the old thing. Sometimes it's impossible to adapt the old thing: for practical purposes, no amount of work will make C secure.

Once criticism of Google is their frequent unexpected shutdown of products. The sunsetting of Google Reader and Google+ caused uproars from their respective users. There is even a [site dedicated to killed Google projects](https://killedbygoogle.com/). Fuchsia could end up on the killed by google list.

[mabbo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mabbo) addresses this criticism:

> Many years ago, I interned at Google and a very wise mentor of mine explained Google to me in a way that has stuck with me.

> "Google discovered a hose that money poured out of. It's called 'online advertising'. All that we do now is find ways to make that hose go faster, and desperately search for another hose."

> Why does Google develop 3+ different OS's? In case one of them is a money hose. Why has Google created thousands of products, only to cancel most of them once people fell in love? Because they decided that they weren't money hoses. 

I find this theory likely. Google certainly isn't starting and stopping projects for giggles. The one's that stick around are revenue generating.

I haven't tried, but it looks easy to [get started](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/get-started) with Fuchsia, if you are interested in building from source. I don't think I will ever own a Nest Hub, but I am interested in trying out the OS as a user in the future.
