My name is Jacob, and I overuse social media. I don't use it anymore than the average American, but it's still too much.

I've read many books about digital distraction and it's harms. Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport, Alone Together by Sherry Tuttle, and Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman. I know I shouldn't use it as much.

But it's hard. I use it to cope with my introverted personality. It's hard for me to go out and meet new people. Especially when talking to people on the internet is so easy.

Anyway, wanted to make this post because of [this article](https://quintusertorius.com/letyourmindrest/). It's a just summary of the books I mentioned. Willpower alone isn't going to stop one from scrolling however. [You can't be addicted to technology](../not-addicted-to-technology-review/). Overusing technology is a symptom of a different problem.
