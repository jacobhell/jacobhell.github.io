"Cars give us freedom". You will hear something like this, or get pressured societally to think this. 

I think not. Cars provide fast transportation with two conditions:

1. A large superconnected system of roads
2. [Ample parking day or night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8p22rtNMoM)

The two conditions exist in the United States. There's no shortage of highways, stroads, or parking. So great, we can go places quickly. Which is great, because things are so far apart.

But why are things so far apart? Read the two conditions again.

For automobile transportation to work, we gave up the freedom of other types of movement. To step outside and walk around is dangerous. Biking to work is unconventional.

Instead of "Cars give us freedom", we should say "cars took our freedom".
